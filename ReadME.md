## Contribute
Feel free to just fork and open a pull request if you want to add something to the addon.
Might be easier if you as beforehand on discord if I agree, so you don't work for nothing :v
Any, and all, version dependant code will not be added. I do not have the time for such a hassle.

I personally think the code is fairly readable. So, shouldn't be an issue. But, again, 
if need be just ask on discord. :)
 - config
   - everything that should be saved between game restarts
 - gui
   - everything shown by the client
 - listeners
   - classes subscribing to Laby events

Anything new that doesn't fit. Make a new directory 
#### Setup project
Be sure to read the [Laby Guide](https://wiki.labymod.net/pages/addon/) on how to make addons and setup the workspace.
Quickly, you should just be able to open it in IntelliJ, add your own Beta Token in `gradle.properties`.
And run the build task to get everything working.

*If you figure out how to add `gradle.properties` to the `.gitignore` with it actually working PLEASE make a PR or tell me how*

Love you all <3 owo (✿◠‿◠)
